# Sokoban Puzzle Solver  

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview    
This project implements a **Sokoban Puzzle Solver** as part of the **Problem Solving** course. It models the **Sokoban game**, implements a solver using **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** and **A\* Search**, and visualizes the solution using **Pygame**.   

## ðŸ›  Features  
- **Game Modeling**: Represents the Sokoban board as a 2D grid with walls, boxes, targets, and the player.  
- **Search Algorithms**:  
  - **BFS**: Explores all possible moves level by level.  
  - **A\***: Uses heuristics to guide the search.  
- **Graphical Interface**: Uses **Pygame** to visualize the board and the solution process.  

## ðŸš€ How to Run  
**1-Update Image Paths**:  
Before running the project, you **must update** the image paths inside `visualizer.py`.  
Make sure all image files used in the GUI are correctly linked.  

**2-Run the Solver**:
python visualizer.py
